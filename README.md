# MeTDDI
# Abstract 
Unexpected drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are important issues for both pharmaceutical research and clinical applications due to the high risk of causing severe adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Many deep learning models have been developed for DDI prediction, but model interpretability to reveal underlying causes of DDI was merely explored. In this work, we propose MeTDDI, a deep learning framework with local-global self-attention and co-attention modules to learn intra- and inter-molecular substructure interactions for DDI prediction based on motif-based graphs. The test results demonstrated that MeTDDI achieved the best overall performance compared with the state-of-the-art models. Regarding interpretability, MeTDDI can visualize potential structures related to DDI mechanisms, which highly matched with the literature-reported functional groups. Besides, additional two case studies were provided to show the potentials of MeTDDI to explain complex DDI mechanisms and mitigate DDI occurrence.
